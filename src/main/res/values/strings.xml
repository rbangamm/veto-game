        Hello there! Welcome to Veto. This game involves two players: a Forcer and a Blocker.
    The Forcer uses the \'X\' pieces and the Blocker uses the \'O\' pieces.\n
    The win conditions are different for each player and they are as follows:\n\n
    Forcer: Wins if a four in a row is achieved; either with his opponent\'s pieces or his own.
    </string>
    <string name="large_text_part2">
        \nBlocker: Wins when the 5 x 5 board is completely filled without any four-in-a-rows.
        The blocker always goes first.\n
    </string>
    <string name="large_text_part3">
        \nSeems easy at first, except the blocker has a secret weaponâ€¦ the Veto!\n\n
    The Veto is represented by the \'V\' piece and it is a move in which the Blocker can place a piece
    that is neither their opponent\'s nor their own on the game board. To use the Veto, the
    Blocker must simply hold the tile on which they would like to place it.
    Keep in mind that only ONE Veto can be used per game.\n\n
    This sums up all the rules, but mastery comes with experience, so make sure to play lots with your friends!
