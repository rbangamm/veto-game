## Game Info
****************************************************************
### What is Veto?
Veto is a turn-based strategy game based on Tic-Tac-Toe. It requires two players: one is called the Forcer and the other is called the Blocker.
The Forcer's goal is to either get four pieces in a row with their own pieces or force the Blocker to make one with their pieces.
The Blocker's goal is to fill up the whole 5 x 5 board without either player getting a four-in-a-row.
The Blocker also has a trump card: the Veto. This 'Veto' piece is not considered to be any of the players' pieces and can be used as a block.
### Who do I play with?
This game can either be played against the AI or against a human player locally on the same device.
